## ‚úèÔ∏è Project Description

This application was developed to demonstrate my skills regarding the technologies used in this project and my logical thinking. This project's purpose is to show the price of cryptocurrencies in real-time. For that, I integrated the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) in a way that the price automatically updates without the need of refreshing the page.

<br />

## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies

- ### TypeScript;

- ### VueJs;

- ### Axios;

- ### SCSS;

<br />

## ü•á Features

The user can:

- View the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in real-time;
- View other info about the cryptocurrencies such as price change percentage per day;
- Search for the price history of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by specifying date;
- Compare the price of cryptocurrencies with other currencies.

<br />
